                                2WJ Media Publishing Nig, Ltd. is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation.
                                Effective Date: February 22, 2021

                                Last Updated on: February 22, 2021

                                Introduction

                                2WJ Media Publishing Nig, Ltd. (“2WJ Studios,” “us,” “our,” or ”we”) respect your
                                privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

                                This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may
                                provide when you visit the website https://2wjstudios.com/ (our “Website”) or download
                                and use our 2WJ Studios Subscription Video On Demand (“SVOD”) app(s) and our practices
                                for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

                                This policy applies to information we collect:

                                On the Website and SVOD.
                                In email, text, and other electronic messages between you, 2WJ Studios, the Website,
                                and/or the SVOD.
                                Through mobile and TV applications you download from Third-Party Platforms, which
                                provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and the Website and/or SVOD.
                                When you use an application that runs on a third-party platform (e.g., iOS, Roku, etc.),
                                the provider of that third-party platform may collect information about you and your use
                                of our application.
                                When you interact with 2WJ Studios advertising and applications on third-party websites
                                and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this policy. We use
                                third-party analytics services to collect data about usage of our services. A Producer
                                may allow third-party advertising companies (including advertising agencies, networks,
                                and delivery vendors) to collect data regarding advertisements that they may place on
                                our websites. Third-party analytics providers and advertising companies may use cookies
                                to track your activities.
                                It does not apply to information collected by:

                                Us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by 2WJ
                                Studios or any third party, including our affiliates and subsidiaries; or
                                Any third party, including our affiliates and subsidiaries, through and including any
                                application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or
                                on the Website.
                                Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding
                                your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and
                                practices, your choice is not to use our Website and/or SVOD. By accessing or using the
                                Website and/or SVOD, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time
                                to time. Your continued use of the Website and/or the SVOD after we make changes is
                                deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for
                                updates.

                                Collection and Use of Personal Information of Children Under the Age of 16

                                Our Website is not intended for children under 16 years of age. No one under age 16 may
                                provide any personal information to or on the Website. Our Website and SVOD are intended
                                to be used by adults, or under the direct supervision of an adult parent or guardian. We
                                do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you are under
                                16, do not use or provide any information on the Website or SVOD or through any features
                                on either platform; do not register on or for the Website and/or SVOD; do not make any
                                purchases through the Website or SVOD; and do not provide any information about yourself
                                to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name
                                or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal information
                                from a child under 16 without verification of parental or adult legal guardian consent,
                                we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or
                                about a child under 16, please contact us immediately at support@2WJ Studios.tv.

                                California residents under 16 years of age may have additional rights regarding the
                                collection and sale of their personal information. Please see our California Resident

                                Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. 2WJ Studios is committed to protecting the
                                online privacy of children. However, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, 2WJ Studios is excluded
                                from the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
                                Although not expressly covered by COPPA, 2WJ Studios strives to meet COPPA’s
                                requirements as part of 2WJ Studios’s commitment to protecting children online. Prior to
                                providing any personally identifiable information (name, e-mail address, address, phone
                                number etc.), either by setting up a SVOD account, entering a contest or sweepstakes (if
                                eligible), or participating in any other activity offered through the Website or SVOD,
                                children under the age of sixteen (16) must have a parent or legal guardian complete and
                                return a parental consent form to 2WJ Studios. The consent form will require the child’s
                                Parent(s) or Legal Guardian(s) to provide their name, signature, and expressly consent
                                to the collection and transfer of the child’s personally identifiable information.
                                Consent may be revoked by sending 2WJ Studios written Revocation of Parental Consent
                                correspondence and sending it to support@2WJ Studios.tv or to 2WJ Media Publishing Nig,

                                information or ordering anything online and urges parents and/or guardians to discuss
                                issues related thereto with their child(ren).

                                Children’s Advertising Review Unit. It is also 2WJ Studios’s intention to adhere to the
                                Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) Guidelines on Internet advertising with its
                                special sensitivities regarding solicitations to children under sixteen (16). 2WJ
                                Studios encourages parents/guardians to supervise and join their children in exploring
                                cyberspace. 2WJ Studios is proud of its SVOD and believes it is suitable for 2WJ Studios
                                fans of all ages.

                                Children’s Information and Third-Party Sponsors. Occasionally, 2WJ Studios may ask, on a
                                voluntary basis and with prior parental permission, if appropriate, for personal
                                information to provide to sponsors of particular activities and/or products. This will
                                be made clear in each individual case where we have third-party sponsors. In the event
                                children under the age of sixteen (16) are eligible, with parental consent, to
                                participate in contests, sweepstakes or other activities offered through our site, we
                                will only collect and use information (e.g., e-mail address, mailing address, name, age)
                                to the extent that it is necessary to administer the activity. We will never require
                                that, as a condition of participation, a child disclose more information than is
                                necessary to participate in an activity.

                                Failure to Obtain Parental Permission. Please note that if a parent does not permit 2WJ
                                Studios’s use or collection of personally identifiable information or has instructed 2WJ
                                Studios to delete personally identifiable information, a child’s participation on the
                                Website or SVOD and/or related activities for which the personally identifiable
                                information has been requested may not be possible.

                                Personal Information Disclosure to Third Parties.

                                2WJ Studios will not disclose information collected from children under the age of
                                sixteen (16) (or from adults for that matter) to third parties unless indicated
                                otherwise or in special cases where 2WJ Studios has reason to believe that disclosure is
                                necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing
                                injury to or interference (whether intentionally or unintentionally) with 2WJ Studios’s
                                rights or property or anyone else who may be harmed by such actions or if required by
                                law.

                                Parental Monitoring and Control Tools.

                                2WJ Studios recommends that parents/guardians monitor and supervise the online
                                activities of their children and to consider using available parental control tools
                                which can prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal
                                information without parental permission. Visitors to 2WJ Studios’s Website or SVOD who
                                are under sixteen (16) years old should not be submitting any personal information like
                                their name, address, e-mail address, phone number etc. without a parent’s or guardian’s
                                permission.

                                of these disclosures. We contractually require these third parties to keep personal
                                information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to
                                them. For more information, see Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information.
                                To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you give us an email
                                address to use the “email a friend” feature of our Website or SVOD, we may transmit the
                                contents of that email and your email address to the recipients.
                                For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.

                                government or regulatory request.

                                safety of 2WJ Studios, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information
                                with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit
                                risk reduction.

                                Data Security

                                We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from
                                accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All
                                information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any
                                payment transactions and related information will be encrypted using SSL technology.

                                The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you
                                (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website and/or
                                SVOD, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to
                                share your password with anyone.

                                Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely
                                secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot
                                guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any
                                transmission of personal information is at your own risks. We are not responsible for
                                circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website or
                                SVOD.

                                Third-Party Services

                                We or a Producer may provide links to third-party websites and applications. We have no
                                control over such services and therefore refer you to their privacy policies for
                                information on their respective privacy practices.

                                Emails

                                When you create an account, you may receive certain emails:

                                Transaction emails: When you first create an account, we may send you a welcome email
                                that provides information about your subscription and your account. If you make a
                                purchase, we may send you an email confirming your purchase. We may also, from time to
                                time, send you other emails concerning your account status. You may not opt out of
                                receiving transactional emails.

                                Emails from 2WJ Studios: When you purchase a subscription, you may agree to receive
                                emails from the 2WJ Studios.

                                2WJ Studios may, via the Vimeo OTT Service, send emails concerning the availability of
                                new video programming in a subscription that you have purchased. If you decide you no
                                longer wish to receive these emails, you may opt out as instructed in each email or in
                                your account settings.

                                Some Producers may email you directly (i.e., through non-Vimeo systems). Vimeo does not
                                control these emails and opting out of Vimeo-sent emails will not cause an opt-out with
                                respect to these emails. To opt out of emails sent directly by Producers, please follow
                                the opt-out instructions set forth in the Producers’ emails.
